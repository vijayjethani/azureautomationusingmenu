__MENU DRIVEN AZURE AUTOMATION__

Menu Driven program is written keep in mind Task which we do regulary on our Azure subscripitons , at times it is difficult to get commands , syntax and parameters. So these menu driven task provides us automation for our subscription management. Depending on Task we want to perform we provide required Menu List number for that task. Program will ask us input relevant to task we want to perform if required. There is no need remember any command line. This has helped me keep my subscription clean and manageable. Hence sharing this menu drive script as reusuable script which you can program according to your needs.

Script is named menuscript.txt located in Script folder , after downloading script file you can rename this script to menuscript.sh before running in your environment
